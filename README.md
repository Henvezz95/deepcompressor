## About This Fork

This repository is a specialized fork of the DeepCompressor framework, tailored specifically to democratize high-fidelity Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models for edge deployment. 

* **What this fork adds:** We introduce a comprehensive W4A4 and INT8 KV-cache quantization pipeline specifically designed for the **Infinity** family of generative models (2B and 8B). It mitigates extreme activation outliers using SVDQuant and compresses the monotonically growing KV-cache via Asymmetric Per-Channel INT8 Quantization. This allows the 8B model to run natively on 16GB edge silicon.
* **Paper:** For full methodological details, evaluation metrics, and edge hardware deployment strategies on NVIDIA Jetson architectures, please refer to our paper: [*Enabling 8B Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generation on Edge GPUs*](https://iris.unimore.it/handle/11380/1400428) (Available Soon).

## Acknowledgements & Upstream Projects

This work builds upon exceptional foundational research. For additional insights, upstream features, and the original codebases, please refer to the following projects:

* **SVDQuant & DeepCompressor:** The foundational quantization engine used in this fork. SVDQuant absorbs outliers by shifting them from activations to weights, then employing a high-precision low-rank branch with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). For the original implementation, additional diffusion model support, and LLM quantization (QServe), visit the [MIT HAN Lab DeepCompressor repository](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/deepcompressor) and read the [SVDQuant paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05007).
* **Infinity VAR:** The target architecture of this fork. Infinity is a Bitwise Visual AutoRegressive Modeling framework capable of generating high-resolution, photorealistic images by predicting bitwise tokens across scales. It refactors visual generation with an infinite-vocabulary classifier and bitwise self-correction. For core model insights, visit the [Infinity Project Page & GitHub](https://foundationvision.github.io/infinity.project/) and read the [Infinity paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04431).

## Installation

### Install from Source

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Henvezz95/deepcompressor.git
cd deepcompressor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
cd Infinity
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

To quantize the Infinity models, execute the `ptq_infinity_new.py` script. The framework relies on a strict configuration hierarchy. You must pass the YAML files as positional arguments to construct the pipeline: defining the model, setting the calibration parameters, and dictating the specific quantization math.

### Running Quantization

The following command executes the baseline quantization pipeline for the Infinity 8B model, utilizing the specific calibration settings defined in `qdiff.yaml` and running the complete **INT4 SVDQuant** pipeline (incorporating both activation smoothing and low-rank weight branches):

python ptq_infinity_new.py configs/models/infinity-8b.yaml configs/collect/qdiff.yaml configs/svdquant/int4.yaml

**Configuration Override Hierarchy:** Positional arguments dictate the override order (files passed later in the command override overlapping keys in earlier files). Ensure all files remain within the relative paths of your working directory. For rapid debugging, you can append additional override configurations (e.g., reducing calibration steps via `fast.yaml`) at the end of the execution chain:

python ptq_infinity_new.py configs/models/infinity-8b.yaml configs/collect/qdiff.yaml configs/svdquant/int4.yaml configs/svdquant/fast.yaml

*(Note: End-to-end evaluation and image generation using the quantized models are handled via separate evaluation scripts, not during this initial PTQ pass).*


## Infinity VAR: 8B Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generation on Edge GPUs

Visual Autoregressive models achieve state-of-the-art fidelity, but the monotonically growing KV-cache introduces a severe Memory Wall, confining these systems to data-center infrastructure. This fork provides a specialized compression pipeline to break that wall.

Through structural profiling, we diagnosed extreme activation outliers in the FFN down-projections of the Infinity architecture (peaking at 353x the median). To resolve this, `ptq_infinity_new.py` extends the **SVDQuant** paradigm to VAR models, decoupling outliers via a low-rank branch. To mitigate the cache footprint without runtime overhead, we implement **Asymmetric Per-Channel INT8 Quantization**, mapping highly skewed channel variances to static 8-bit limits optimized via Golden-Section Search. 

This pipeline reduces the peak memory of the Infinity 8B model by 64% (from 37.1 GB to 13.3 GB), enabling local execution on mid-range edge devices. 

### Generative Quality Evaluation
Below is the generation quality evaluated with 5,000 samples from the MJHQ-30K dataset. Our quantization pipeline retains near-FP16 aesthetic alignment (ImageReward) while compressing the model severely.

| Model | Precision | Method | FID (↓) | ImageReward (↑) | CLIP-IQA (↑) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Infinity 8B | FP16 | -- | 19.6 | 1.18 | 0.945 |
| | INT W4A4 | SVDQuant + KV8 | 19.0 | 1.13 | 0.935 |
| Infinity 2B | FP16 | -- | 21.3 | 0.981 | 0.947 |
| | INT W4A4 | SVDQuant + KV8 | 20.2 | 0.840 | 0.919 |

### Hardware Efficiency Benchmarks
System footprint and end-to-end latency measured on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin 64GB. The "Feasible HW" tier indicates the minimum commercial module required to run the model natively in memory.

| Model | Precision | Peak Memory | Latency | Feasible HW |

| Infinity 8B | FP16 | 37.1 GB | 25.1 s | AGX Orin (64GB) |
| Infinity 8B | INT W4A4 + KV8 | **13.3 GB** | **27.0 s** | **Orin NX (16GB)** |
| Infinity 2B | FP16 | 16.0 GB | 8.46 s | AGX Orin (32GB) |
